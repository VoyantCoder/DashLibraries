<name>Support</name>
<description>
In the case of the need for support, due to whatever, related to the software you are using; you could always push me a message at KvinneKraft@protonmail.com.\n\n
For anything else, support related, regardless of the support needing to be related to the software, you could also use the same email to get in touch.\n\n
I usually respond within a 7-day time span, if I do not however, do not hesitate to resend the sent email.  Protonmail servers tend to disallow emails from coming through.\n\n

<name>Safety</name>
<description>
I guess this topic does not really fit under the name "Helper GUI", but may I say; the relevance of the contents of an application is defined by whomever may be responsible for the existence of such.\n\n
In other words, I do not feel like relevance is required here, since you are curious regardless, else you would not have read this.\n\n
That is, of course, if I assume you clicked the button which is associated with this text.\n\n
But, to get to the point -if you have any doubts about the safety of this application- you can find the actual source code here: https://github.com/KvinneKraft somewhere in the Framework section.\n\n
If you are still in doubt, feel free to download the source code and compile it for yourself.\n\n
Though I have no official license under this source code (as of now-), I would really appreciate any credits if you were to redistribute any parts of my source code.\n\n
