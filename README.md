<h3> Hey there! Hold on! </h1>
<p> I am currently working on a new edition of this Framework. Though commitments to this repository have been lacking. Behind the screens a lot of changes have been going on. I have been busy with other projects, making me unable to separately commit to this one. When I look through these codes I feel like I have the urge to recode it all. Which I am doing as we speak. It will come bundled with the new project I am working on and will also be available separately, in a repository like this one. </p>
<p>
The current Framework will no longer be considered a Framework. Simply because it is not a Framework but more so a library. I just called it a Framework. Regardless. Expect fancy codes. They are upcoming. Within a few months the product should be finished. It is a side project, hence the delay.

If you have suggestions for implementations, then you can always reach out to me at my Email. Which can be found on my profile <a href="https://github.com/VoyantCoder"> page, here. </a>

I also have a few other projects upcoming. One of them being my completely new website. Fully rebuilt from scratch by hand. It will make use of React, for the first time in my website history. It will also have a lot of PHP. What I am trying to get at is; this year awaits many changes.
