# Dash Framework Open-Source Build 4.0
##
## I figured, why not publish the Framework I use to build my applications?  It is open source anyways ;)
##
> The Dash Framework is currently undergoing maintenance even though update 4.0 was already ready for use.  No worries though, no known bugs are present for as far as I know right now, however; if you do find any, please let me know at KvinneKraft@protonmail.com.

> Many changes are planned down on paper, many commitments were made previously but they do not show up on public record so I figured it was about time to change that.  Look at the development of this project as it comes along.  I have 15+ expansions planned as of now, the list grows everyday.  So, stay tuned, lol!
