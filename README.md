I am forever changing, after all, I do not believe in constant values.  Anything which I define can be redefined.  Therefore, my way of coding fluctuates all over the place.  It shows me how much progression I have made.  To use the skills you possess for work is one thing, but to elaborate on these skills and to strive towards the improvement of your ability to make use of these skills is another story.  I want to learn, I refuse to stay stuck to one way of coding, or one way of living period.
